# Buses Are us
 ## Project Introduction:
 
 An Android application that maps the location of stops, buses and bus routes on the Greater Vancouver Transit system
(Translink) and retrieves real time arrival information at those stops. It also plots the user's location on the map
and highlights the nearest bus stop.
